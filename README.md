Dialog applicant test
=====================

Welcome! For this test you will have access to a Dialog PC, with basic Visual Studio, VS Code, and, or course, internet access. Please:

1. Clone this repo, which contains a C# WebAPI and a bare *'index.html'* file.
2. Create a branch using your full name.
3. Based on the wireframe diagram (*'Progtest/BMICalc.png'*) please create a HTML page (ideally raw HTML, but any framework is ok) to calculate a BMI (it's ok: you can google the algorithm.)
4. The result should appear with the background RAG charted based on Green for normal, Amber for under/over, or Red for obese.
5. Commit to your branch, and push back to origin.

Please note that visual reproduction of the wireframe is not their main focus - a less pretty, well coded solution with all fields and the end-to-end API calculation will be preferred over a glossy front-end that doesnâ€™t function.

Thanks, and good luck.
